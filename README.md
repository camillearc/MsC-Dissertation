Hi! This repository contains all the data for my MsC dissertation. All data may not currently be uploaded but hopefully soon it will contain: 
* All visualization code
* All analysis (GLM, 3dttest, SVM+weights) code
* Some actual visualizations
* Cluster tables for SVM weights and ttest data.


I believe in teaching myself and practicing open data science and this is the best I currently have access to that capability.
